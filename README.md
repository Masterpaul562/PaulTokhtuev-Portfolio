## Some of my game dev projects
<details> 
  <summary>Goblin Survivor</summary>
An unfinished demo for my game dev 1 class. The premise was to create something like Vampire Survivor. The gameplay is that different enemies shoot at or chase you, and you have to shoot them back while collecting coins to upgrade your weapons.  We used Processing to create it. My job on the team was coding, so I created the enemy and projectile logic.

  <summary>Momentum-Break</summary>
  A short game made in Unity. I'm currently working on it, so it is unfinished. We went with a beat 'em up style to the game, so its focus is on comboing the enemies and simple progressing forward through a simple level.

Projects I made for my Video Production class. I work with a team to gather footage and did all the editing in the videos below. I learned the basics of Premiere Pro and how to import and export the files needed to make videos.
